# Network formulations

Two different network formulations have been used in the FlexPlan package to represent meshed AC/DC transmission networks and radial AC distribution networks, respectively. The linearised 'DC' power flow formulation is used for the meshed networks, whereas, the linearised 'DistFlow' formulation is used to represent the radial distribution networks. 

For the comprehensive formulation of the network equations, along with the detailed model for storage and demand flexbility, the readers are referred to the FlexPlan deliverable 1.2 ["Probabilistic optimization of T&D systems planning with high grid flexibility and its scalability"](https://flexplan-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/D1.2_20210325_V1.0.pdf)
