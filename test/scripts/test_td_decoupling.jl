# Test of transmission and distribution decoupling

# Note 1
# Only distribution part is implemented at the moment: given a distribution network having some
# candidate storage / flexible loads, a set of flexibility candidates is returned.
# The entire distribution network is seen as a flexibility candidate by transmission. Multiple
# candidates related to the same distribution network represent alternative planning options, which
# vary in amount of flexibility provided and in cost.

# Note 2
# Among flexibility sources in distribution, only storage is considered at the moment.
