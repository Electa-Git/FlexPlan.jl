    "The first test will verify that the slack variable used for representing load shedding in an intact grid (i.e. without considering contingencies) works as intended. This variable should get a non-zero value only if the generation is not sufficient to supply the load demand, and for these hours a cost of energy not supplied should be incurred. The model specification currently specifies multiple decision (slack) variables with associated cost parameters that could be used to represent this: Compensation for load curtailment $C^{nce}_{u,t,y}$ compensation for consuming less $C^{nce}_{u,t,y}$ and nodal load slack cost associated non-supplied load $C^{LL}_{u,t,y}$. The purpose of this test is to test functionality that is similar to load shedding due to contingencies before extending the implementation to actually represent contingencies. (If not correctly implemented, one could end up with load curtailment due to contingencies causing non-zero values for the wrong slack variables.) The compensation for consuming less $C^{nce}_{u,t,y}$ should only be relevant when flexible demand is present and could therefore be neglected here. \n",
    "\n",
    "To provoke load shedding without contingencies, the easiest approach may be to reduce the power transfer capacity of the lines feeding into the bus that for which one will provoke load shedding. Bus 4 and bus 5 are connected to the rest of the network by only two branches each, making it relatively easier to control the power supply to these buses. When the power transfer capacities are reduced below a certain threshold, the variable one should get $L^{ref}_{u,t,y}-L^{Lc}_{u,t,y}$ and an additional operational cost $C^{Lc}_{u,t,y}(L^{ref}_{u,t,y}-L^{Lc}_{u,t,y}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "A second step in the test can be to put one of the two branches feeding the selected load bus in an outage state. This should give the same result as the test above if the power transfer limit of the remaining branch feeding the bus is set to an appropriate value for getting load shedding at the bus.\n"

Similarly, a demand flexibility at these load buses should give solutions with (voluntary) curtailment of load (and possibly shifting of load) rather than (involuntary) shedding of load.
